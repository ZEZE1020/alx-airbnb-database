# Mastering SQL Joins

This directory demonstrates how to use different types of SQL joins in the context of our Airbnb-like schema.

## Files

- **joins_queries.sql**  

  Contains three example queries showcasing:

  1. `INNER JOIN` between `booking` and `users`  

  2. `LEFT JOIN` between `property` and `review`  

  3. `FULL OUTER JOIN` between `users` and `booking`

## Prerequisites

1. A running PostgreSQL database populated with the Airbnb schema and sample data. Please check /database-script-0x01 to get started

2. `psql` or another SQL client with access to your database.  

---

## How to Run

From the repository root:

```bash

psql -d airbnb_db -f database-adv-script/joins_queries.sql

Each queryâ€™s result will be printed to your console.

```

### Query Breakdown

***INNER JOIN*** Retrieves only bookings that have a matching user record. Use case: display a list of confirmed reservations along with guest details.

***LEFT JOIN*** Fetches every property, attaching reviews if they exist. Use case: generate a report showing all listings and highlight those with no feedback yet.

***FULL OUTER JOIN*** Combines users and bookings so that:

Users without bookings still appear (null booking fields).

Bookings without a linked user (if any) still appear (null user fields). Use case: auditing orphaned bookings or identifying users who have never booked.


# SQL Subqueries Practice

The file subqueries.sql contains subqueries samples that can be used to retrieve user specific information with example relating to properties with reviews and users to bookings. 

## Files

- **subqueries.sql**  

  - **Query 1 (Non-Correlated):** Lists properties with an average review rating above 4.0.  

  - **Query 2 (Correlated):** Lists users who have made more than 3 bookings, with a booking count.

## Prerequisites

Maintain the same database as stated in the beginning.

## How to Run

From the repository root, execute:

```bash

psql -d airbnb_db -f database-adv-script/subqueries.sql \
```

This will print two result sets:

High-Rated Properties (avg rating > 4.0)

Frequent Guests (users with > 3 bookings)

## Query Breakdown

### Non-Correlated Subquery

Uses a derived table (avg_rev) to compute average ratings per property.

Filters with HAVING AVG(rating) > 4.0.

Joins back to property for human-readable names.

### Correlated Subquery

For each user row in users, the subquery counts bookings in booking where b.user_id = u.user_id.

The outer WHERE clause filters users whose booking count exceeds 3.

Correlated because the inner SELECT refers to the outer alias u.user_id.
