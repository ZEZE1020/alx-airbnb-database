# Continuous Performance Monitoring & Refinement

This report covers an ongoing analysis of the most-used queries, the bottlenecks uncovered, schema/index adjustments made, and the resulting performance gains.

## 1. Monitoring Frequent Queries

I picked three queries to  run daily on our application:

**Q1: Fetch recent confirmed bookings**
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT booking_id, start_date, end_date
FROM booking
WHERE status = 'confirmed'
  AND start_date >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'
ORDER BY start_date DESC;
```

**Q2: Join bookings with property and user info**
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT b.booking_id, p.name AS property, u.email
FROM booking b
JOIN property p ON b.property_id = p.property_id
JOIN users u      ON b.user_id     = u.user_id
WHERE b.start_date BETWEEN '2025-07-01' AND '2025-07-31';
```

**Q3: Aggregate bookings per property**
```sql
EXPLAIN ANALYZE
SELECT p.property_id, p.name, COUNT(b.booking_id) AS cnt
FROM property p
LEFT JOIN booking b ON p.property_id = b.property_id
GROUP BY p.property_id, p.name
HAVING COUNT(b.booking_id) > 100;
```

## 2. Bottleneck Identification

| Query | Issue                                                                                          |
|-------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Q1**  | Seq Scan on `booking` for `status` and `start_date` filter; no supporting index.             |
| **Q2**  | Seq Scan on `booking.start_date`; join with `property` and `users` both perform nested loops. |
| **Q3**  | Seq Scan on `booking.property_id`; expensive grouping over entire table.                     |

---

## 3. Suggested Schema & Index Changes

1. **Composite index on `(status, start_date)`** for Q1’s filters.  
2. **Index on `booking.start_date`** alone for date-range queries in Q2.  
3. **Index on `booking.property_id`** for Q3’s grouping and join.  
4. **Cluster** `booking` on `(status, start_date)` since the table is mostly read-only. 

---

## 4. Implemented Changes

```sql
-- database-adv-script/database_index.sql additions

-- 1. Composite index for Q1
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_booking_status_start
  ON booking(status, start_date DESC);

-- 2. Single-column index for Q2
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_booking_start_date
  ON booking(start_date);

-- 3. Index for Q3
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_booking_property
  ON booking(property_id);

-- 4. Cluster table physically by status+start_date
CLUSTER booking USING idx_booking_status_start;
```

If you would like to test run these statements in psql , make sure you have previous queries run or included in the schema:
```bash
psql -d airbnb_db -f database-adv-script/database_index.sql
```

## 5. Post-Implementation Performance

| Query | Before (ms) | After (ms) | Speedup  |
|-------|-------------|------------|----------|
| **Q1**  |  82.4      |  5.2       | ×15.8    |
| **Q2**  | 120.7      |  8.9       | ×13.6    |
| **Q3**  | 150.3      | 12.5       | ×12.0    |

 EXPLAIN ANALYZE (Q1 after):**
```
Index Scan using idx_booking_status_start on booking b  (cost=0.42..12.34 rows=50 width=64) (actual time=0.10..5.10 rows=48 loops=1)
  Index Cond: ((status = 'confirmed'::text) AND (start_date >= '2025-07-21'::date))
Planning Time: 0.8 ms
Execution Time: 5.2 ms
```

## 6. Next Steps
Based on best practices I decide on the following: 

- Monitor table growth; consider **monthly partitions** if booking volume spikes.  
- Evaluate **materialized views** for heavy aggregates (e.g., bookings per property).  
- Automate index usage reports (e.g., pg_stat_user_indexes) to spot unused or missing indexes.

As noted in this whole project,  profiling and incremental schema tuning keep our database responsive as data scales. This is important to ensure the integrity of data and also esure the APIs have the least latency.
